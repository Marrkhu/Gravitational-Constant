# Calculating-Gravitational-Constant
This Python model reads a video file and extracts frames from it to obtain data on the position of a moving object. It then analyses the position of the object over time to plot its trajectory and estimate the acceleration due to gravity. The model uses the OpenCV and NumPy libraries for image processing and data manipulation, and the Matplotlib and Scipy libraries for visualisation and image analysis. The position of the object is determined by finding the coordinates of the largest particle in each frame using a thresholding method, and the trajectory is plotted by connecting the particle positions over time. The model also calculates the acceleration due to gravity using the measured trajectory and compares it to a model prediction.
